# 📓 Churn Prediction Notebook

## 📖 Overview

This Jupyter notebook is part of a churn prediction case study. Churn prediction is related to detection of which customers tend to cancel a service or stop to using a product. Companies spend money to acquire new clients, so clients losses represent investment lost. Retaining clients can be less expensive that acquiring new ones. The goal of this notebook is to build a churn prediction model using Jupyter Notebook and Python. By study purposes some steps of CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) will be followed.
